# Responsive Refactor (Admin / Backoffice)

## Summary
The admin (/admin, /dev) interface previously forced a desktop canvas using a hard viewport meta tag:

```
width=1280, initial-scale=1
```

On mobile devices this produced a scaled-down snapshot that required pinch-zoom for readability and created a "shrunk desktop" experience instead of a natural responsive layout.

## Changes Implemented
1. Root viewport logic updated in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`:
   - Default for ALL routes is now: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover`.
   - Optional legacy flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGACY_ADMIN_FIXED_WIDTH=1` restores the old fixed 1280px viewport ONLY for /admin & /dev paths (intended as a temporary fallback during migration).
2. Admin layout refactored (`admin/layoutClient.tsx`):
   - Removed hard `width:1280px` canvas except when legacy flag active.
   - Introduced fluid container: `w-full max-w-[1280px] px-4 md:px-6` with vertical flex column.
   - Preserves previous visual rhythm while allowing content to shrink naturally on small screens.
3. Representative page updated (`admin/orders/page.tsx`):
   - Removed `min-w-[1080px]` hard table width.
   - Wrapped table with an `overflow-x-auto` container; table now `w-full` and uses smaller base font on narrow screens (`text-xs sm:text-sm`).
   - Enables graceful wrapping / horizontal scroll only if absolutely needed.

## Feature Flag
| Flag | Purpose | When to Use | How to Remove |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGACY_ADMIN_FIXED_WIDTH` | Re-enable old 1280px fixed canvas for /admin & /dev | Emergency rollback if a page breaks responsively | Delete the env var once all pages are confirmed responsive |

Set it in your environment (e.g. `.env` or deployment config):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGACY_ADMIN_FIXED_WIDTH=1
```
Default (unset / any other value) = responsive mode.

## Migration Guidance for Remaining Pages
If additional admin pages rely on large fixed tables:
1. Remove hard `min-w-[####px]` unless absolutely required.
2. Wrap wide table(s) with: `<div className="overflow-x-auto">`.
3. Consider mobile font scaling: add `text-xs sm:text-sm` to dense tables.
4. Prefer content wrapping (`break-words`, `truncate` with title tooltips) for long text fields.
5. Use cards on very dense multi-column data if readability still suffers below ~400px.

## Accessibility & UX Rationale
- True responsive viewport improves initial legibility and reduces cognitive load.
- Users retain pinch-zoom control (we did NOT set `maximum-scale=1`).
- Fluid layout removes double-scroll / inner pinch artifacts common with scaled desktop iframes.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open /admin on a mobile device (or dev tools emulation <= 400px width): navigation and top bar fit without horizontal scroll.
- [ ] Orders page table readable; horizontal scroll appears only if columns overflow collectively.
- [ ] No layout shift or hydration warning caused by new script.
- [ ] Legacy flag toggled ON returns old behavior (verify forced 1280px width meta present in head).

## Rollback Plan
If a critical page breaks:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGACY_ADMIN_FIXED_WIDTH=1` in environment.
2. Redeploy (restores 1280px canvas for /admin & /dev).
3. Patch the broken page to responsive pattern, then unset the flag.

## Next Opportunities
- Audit other pages for `min-w-[` usage and apply same pattern.
- Introduce utility class (e.g. `.table-responsive`) to standardize wrapping and font scaling.
- Add Playwright / Cypress visual regression for widths 360px, 768px, 1280px.
